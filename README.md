## About the Project

This project is a clone of the popular video streaming service Netflix, created using the following technologies and tools:

- **Vue 3**: A powerful JavaScript framework that makes building user interfaces convenient and efficient.

- **Vite**: A fast and modern development tool that allows you to create Vue projects quickly and with minimal overhead.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A minimalist CSS framework that speeds up the styling process and helps create beautiful user interfaces.

- **Pinia**: State management is handled using Pinia, providing clean and straightforward state management.

- **HTML and JavaScript**: Core languages for building the user interface and application logic.

This project was created with the guidance of the [John Weeks Dev]([https://www.youtube.com/@johnweeksdev]) YouTube channel.
